        The state mutation addModule, primarily used for creating mod_subsection
        instances, has been deprecated. Replace it with newModule. Additionally,
        all course formats using links with data-action="addModule" must be updated
        to use data-action="newModule" and include a data-sectionid attribute
        specifying the target section ID.
