    - message: >
        New quiz setting "precreateperiod" controls the period before timeopen
        during which attempts will be pre-created using the new

        NOT_STARTED state. This setting is marked advanced and locked by
        default, so can only be set by administrators. This setting

        is read by the \mod_quiz\task\precreate_attempts task to identify
        quizzes due for pre-creation.
      type: improved
    - message: >
        quiz_attempt_save_started Now takes an additional $timenow parameter, to
        specify the timestart of the attempt. This was previously

        set in quiz_create_attempt, but is now set in quiz_attempt_save_started
        and quiz_attempt_save_not_started.
