issueNumber: MDL-68806
notes:
  core_question:
    - message: >
        question_attempt_step's constructor now accepts the class constant
        TIMECREATED_ON_FIRST_RENDER as a value for the

        $timecreated parameter. Calling question_attempt::render for the first
        time will now set the first step's timecreated

        to the current time if it is set to this value. Note, null could not be
        used here as it is already used to indicate

        timecreated should be set to the current time.
      type: changed
