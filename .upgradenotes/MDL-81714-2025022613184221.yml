notes:
  core:
    - message: >
        The stored progress API has been updated. The
        `\core\output\stored_progress_bar` class has

        now has a `store_pending()` method, which will create a record for the
        stored process, but

        without a start time or progress percentage.

        `\core\task\stored_progress_task_trait` has been updated with a new
        `initialise_stored_progress()` method,

        which will call `store_pending()` for the task's progress bar. This
        allows the progress bar to be displayed

        in a "pending" state, to show that a process has been queued but not
        started.

    - message: >
        A new `\core\output\task_indicator` component has been added to display
        a progress bar and message

        for a background task using `\core\task\stored_progress_task_trait`. See
        the "Task indicator"

        page in the component library for usage details.

  core_grades:
    - message: >
        `grade_regrade_final_grades()` now has an additional `async` parameter,
        which allows full course

        regrades to be performed in the background. This avoids blocking the
        user for long periods and

        while making changes to a large course. The actual regrade is performed
        using the

        `\core_course\task\regrade_final_grades` adhoc task, which calls
        `grade_regrade_final_grades()`

        with `async: false`.
