notes:
  core:
    - message: >
        url class now correctly supports multi level query parameter parsing and
        output.


        This was previously supported in some methods such as get_query_string,
        but not others. This has been fixed to be properly supported.


        For example https://example.moodle.net?test[2]=a&test[0]=b will be
        parsed as ['test' => [2 => 'a', 0 => 'b']]


        All parameter values that are not arrays are casted to strings.
      type: fixed
