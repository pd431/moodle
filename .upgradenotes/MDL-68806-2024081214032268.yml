        The webservice function `mod_quiz_get_user_attempts` is now deprecated
        in favour of `mod_quiz_get_user_quiz_attempts`.


        With the introduction of the new NOT_STARTED quiz attempt state,
        `mod_quiz_get_user_attempts` has been modified to not return NOT_STARTED
        attempts, allowing clients such as the mobile app to continue working
        without modifications.


        `mod_quiz_get_user_quiz_attempts` will return attempts in all states, as
        `mod_quiz_get_user_attempts` did before. Once clients are updated to
        handle NOT_STARTED attempts, they can migrate to use this function.


        A minor modification to `mod_quiz_start_attempt` has been made to allow
        it to transparently start an existing attempt that is in the NOT_STARTED
        state, rather than creating a new one.

      type: deprecated
